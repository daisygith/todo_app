Created this project was purpose main learned Angular, TypeScript, PL/SQL.

This project is useful to manage tasks.

- [x] App has searched all tasks from database.
- [x] we can ADD new task.
- [x] we can UPDATE added task ( change description, status or finish date).

In **plsql file** is code from TODO base. I created there:

- sequence for increment id;
- procedures for:

    - add task
    - update task
    - delete task
    - update status task
  - **Procedure for check task status is called by DBMS_SCHEDULER 'check_task_status'** -> this job check every day about 23:59 that 
  status each task with finish date equal current day is "DONE", If not change on status "DONE".
